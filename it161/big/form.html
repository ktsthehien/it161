            <p>HTML form on a web page allows a user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing. According to Brandon Satrom, “A web form is a medium that allows your visitors to get in contact with you and to send information, such as an order, a catalog request, or even a query, which is passed on to your database. On some websites, information that is submitted through web forms is transferred directly to the company email. Web forms are constructed in programming languages like PHP, HTML, or JavaScript. A successful implementation of the code is essential for the success of the form”(Puri).</p>
            
            <p>Web forms play an important role in creating the communication bridge between business and customers. An appropriate form to the right audience and targeted market will enhance the business image. In contrast, illogical and inappropriate questions will hamper the company image quite easily. Example: Asking for a residential address is rather irrelevant if the goal is making the users create an account with the website. Users will wonder why the site asks for a residential address just for registration. Not only will this cause confusion, but also a loss of trust, and most likely the user might quit the registration process (Puri).</p>
            
            <p>Another reason why you need to use a web form is that it acts like the substitute and is available to take queries at all times. According to Kaveri Bharali,  “running a business is not very easy. It involves a lot of tasks to be taken care of. Being the owner you are responsible to look over every aspect of your business. So you may not be able to answer all inquiries immediately. But with a Contact form in hand, this is no longer an issue. You can set an automated reply which will be received by the sender as soon as he/she hits the send button” (Bharali).</p>
            
            <p>In addition, using a form also helps protect  the website from spams. Kaveri Bharali noted that “adding your email address directly on your website can only open your inbox to spammers. Using a Contact Form saves all your time and energy from clearing them out. It helps you keep a very secured layer around your website because it constantly works by filtering any kind of spam that comes your way” (Bharali).</p>
            
            <p>A good web form is one that is capable of calling to the users action and predicting their participation. The key to create a form is to understand the common mistakes users make. Designers need to create a pleasant and convenient user experience and keep the form clear, simple, and reliable (Puri).</p>
